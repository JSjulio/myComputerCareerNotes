?Vocabulary & Concepts  


*Shell - 
is a translator. it taskes the CLI commands, translates them for the kernel, letting you command the computer 
    the extension of this script is .sh 
    
*Linmux
 a case sensitive OS that derived from unix. created by Linus Torvalds in 1991  

    Key features: 

    -Allows you to use the computer's hardware devices 
    -defines user interface standards 
    -provides basic tools that allow applications to run 
    -Manages system resources 

*Real-World Analogy 
    OS is the management sys of a restaraunt. Overseeing the kitchen staff, servers, and providing a good exp to customers 

* Kernel - core that manages hardware and computer resources

    Responsibiltiies include: 
        hardware interfacing, communicates with network adapters, hard disk, and other devices 

    Memory allocation 
        distributes memory to individual programs 

    CPU time management 
        allocates process time to different programs 

    Program interaction 
        enables programs to communicate with each other 

    Real-world comoparison 
        -kernel is like an air traffic controller at a busy airport.
        -Managing which planes (programs) can use the runway (CPU), 
            -he fuels them - giving them memory 
            -coordinates their w/u with ground services (hardware)

*Understanding Linux  

    *Kernel - 
    core control software 

    *Libraries and Utilities 
     Tools that rely on the kernel to rpovide features

    *Open Source Software 
    Most distros are free , some need payment 

    *Linux philosophy 
    Everything is a file, from hardware devices, to processes, and system information are all represented as files. This simplification makes systems administration more consistent and predictable 


*Comparing other OS' to Linux 

    UNIX - Began in 1969 | OG multi-user OS 

    Linux - Began in 1991 | modern day unix clone

    Mac OS X - commercial Unix based system | with apple's custom interface 

*Comparing / contrasting 

    Linux vs MacOS     
        Similar - Mac Terminal / Linux run many simular commands 

        differences - Mac uses propprietary closed source software
    
    Linux vs Windows 
        
        Differences  

            -Linux Open Source, Windows is closed 
            -Linux is free / windows is $ 
            -Linux is very customizable 
            -Windows has broad consumer hardware support 
            -Linux has different security acrchitecture 

*Linux Distibution 

    is a complete OS with includes 
        -linux kernel 
        -system utilities 
        -package management system 
        -application software
        -installation tools 

    *Linux is the car market 
    
        see different distros as different car brands with the simular engines (kernels)...
    
        However, they had different features, interafaces, support systems to meet different needs


*GNU - 'GNU Not Unix' (recursive acronym) 
 
    -is a free/open source software OS, created by Richard Stallman in 1983. 
    -Provides system tools, libraries, and compilers (GCC)
    -& Linux Kernel it forms Linux 

    -open source operating system and massive collection of essential software tools and utilities. 


*Understanding the GNU + Linux Dynamic 

    *GNU functionality  

        -GNU Provides commands: 
            1.file operations (ls, cp, mv, rm, cat, grep)
            2.text editors: nano, emacs 
            3.compressions: tar, gzip 
            4.compilers: gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)
            5.Shell: bash (Bourne Again Shell)

    *Linux provides:
        -the kernel (core/resource manager)



*Gnome 
free / open source desktop environment...simple, minimalistic

*GUI  
graphical user interface 

*LTS 
(Longterm support),
-special versioning of a app which 
-refreshed every 2 years
-most stable versioning 
-hopstial could choose this to prevent frequent app updates 


*Embedded / Specialized Linux Applications 
are stripped down systems running on microcomputers 
    smartphones 
    smartTvs
    IoT Devices - small devices that sense physical conditions 
        (smart homes, industrial monitoring, agriculture, healthcare monitoring devices 

*Network Appliances 
    Routers, printers, firewalls - most run on linuz 

*Cloud Computing and Linux

    *Understanding Cloud Computing - delivery of 
        -1. Software 2. Storage 3. Servers 4. Networking over the internet 
        - it's like using electricity from a utility company instead of generating your own power. 

    *Types of Clouds

        *Public Clouds 
        Third party computing resources 

        *Private Cloud 
        Org builds and maintains it's own cloud infrastructure 

    *Hybrid Cloud 
        Combination of private and public cloud resources 

    *Tpes of Cloud Service Models 

        *IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service 
        Basic computer resources - VMs, storage, networking 

        *SaaS - Software as a Service 
        Complete ready to use application 

        *PaaS - Platform as a Serviice 
        complete development and deployment env


*
package manager tools for (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux, Mint, POP_OS)

    .deb - Debian package file format (this is like .exe on Windows)

    dpkg - low-level package manager for Debian based systems 

    apt - higher level tool that uses dpkg underneath (Easier to use)

root - the superuser account with complete system control. This gives you full admin priviliges mean you can do anything, including break the system 

*Software Licensing 

    *1. Commericial Software 
    -created with the intent to sell for profit 
    -source code kept private 
    -users cannot modify the software 
    -rerdistribution is illegal 

    *2. Shareware 
    -Distributed freely but payment expected after trial perioid 
    -Operates on "honor system" 

    *3. Freeware 
    -FOR FREEEEEEE
    -Author doesn't ask for payment 
    -Free versioning can be limited
    -Simular legal restrictions to commercial software 

    *Four Essential Freedoms (FEF)
        0 - use software for any purpose 
        1 - study and modify the source code 
        2 - Redistribute copies to help others 
        3 - Improves the software and share imporovements 

    *Open Source Initiative (OSI)    
        1998 by Bruce Perens and Eric S. Raymond Goal: Promote open source software in business environments
            
            10 Key Principles (summarized):
            1. Free redistribution
            2. Source code availability
            3. Permission to create derived works
            4. Integrity of author's source code
            5. No discrimination against persons or groups
            6. No discrimination against fields of endeavor
            7. Distribution of license
            8. License must not be specific to a product
            9. License must not restrict other software
            10. License must be technology neutra

    *Important Open Source License 
        
        *GPL 
        (Genral Public License) - free software license that garuntees end-users the freedom to run study share and modify software 
            (this wasa used for engineering of the Linux Kernel / GNU tools) 

        *Apache License
        -Business friendly open source license
        -Has patent proftection clauses 
        -Example: Apache Web Server, Android OS 

    
*Creative Commons

    Linux Troubleshooting and Diagnostics


2. What commands would grant additional users access to use the sudo command?

   B. sudo vi /etc/sudoers 
   C. sudoedit /etc/sudoers

3. What is the argument in the command [root@localhost ~]# ls -la /usr ?
    -usr 

4. When changing user contexts what benefit is there to using su - <username> instead of su <username>?
 
   A. It creates a full login session that changes directories


5. What Linux shell command is used to display help?

    man 
 
6. Question: How many Linux distributions are there?

    Hundreds 


7. What is the focus of Open Source software?

    community collaboration


8. What is the impact of running the dash shell instead of a bash shell? 

    - A small percentage of the commands will be different 


9.  In what year did Linus Torvalds announce his new free operating system?

    -1991 

10. What command is used to run only a single command under the root administrator context?

    sudoedit <command>


? Bourne-again Shell & Scripting 

1. What command would make a variable called SCRDEPTH global so that it could be used in any Bash session?

   *export SCRDEPTH=value

    to make it available across all child session I would need to do: 
        echo 'export SCRDEPTH=value' >> ~/.bashrc


2. Question: Where is the best place to put global custom Bash configuration settings that would apply to every user on a system?

    * /etc/profile.d/ is the preferred location because:

        It's designed specifically for custom configurations
        You can create separate files for different purposes (e.g., /etc/profile.d/custom-vars.sh)

        It keeps configurations modular and organized
        Files in this directory are automatically sourced by /etc/profile

        It's easier to manage and won't get overwritten during system updates

## Learning Lab 
 <!-- 
 
 *MS-DOS : Disk operating system  
    -Command Line interface set up
    -users would install MS Windows ontop of MSDOS. 
    
*Understanding Historical Drive Layout

    -floppy disk function as the system drive
        drives - store/power systems  
    -MS-DOS had two drives (A+B), then three, then four  
        A:  floppy drive   
        B:  floppy drive 
        C:  hardive (internal disk)
        'Windows' Drive: where windows was installed

    
 *Understanding Linux Files 

    *Linux Directory Tree 
    -Every partition, removable disk, network file share, and other storage is accessible as a directory in a single directory tree, 
    -root is the base to all files  

*Distinguished directories
    have a specific purpose or seperate devices that mounted of the root drive

*Importance of knowing each directory 
    understanding the main purpose of the main directories enable you to locate files and avoid mistakes 
 



*Directory Breakdown

    * / - (root) 
    -The top-level directory. 
    -home directory for the root user (superuser)

    -Essential 4 booting, restoring, managing disk partitions 
    -The require root privilege
      

    * /bin - (binaries [meaning programs /apps])
    -User Binaries r needed for single-user mode and basic system operations.
    -opertional cmds provided: ls, cp, mv, cat, bash, chmod

        -Critical 4 startup

    * /dev  (devices)
    Devices files contain directories for 
        1. hardware 
        (i.e disk = dev/sda)
        (partitions on ^disk would be sda1, sda2, etc)

        2. essential software tools 
            i.e: 
                a.dev/sda - hardware devices f
                b.dev/tty - terminal 
                c.dev/null & dev/random - allow for programs to
                d. interact with harware through files operations

    * /etc (et-cetera)
    -System-wide configuration files here  
    -ONLY shell scripts.

        -hidden directories store: cache, thumbnails etc. 
 
    -directories here have application settings as well 



    * /mnt 
    -where you would find temporary mounted drives

    -A, B, D, drives are here! 
    -Traditionally used by admins to manually mount drives or network shares. 
    -Normally used with manual mounting 
    
    * /media 
    -Distros now automatically mount external mounts to the media directory  
    -including USB drives, CD-ROMs, external hard drives. 
    -i.e: USB would be @ Media/username/device name

    * /opt (optional)
    -Manually installed software from vendors live here 
     -& 3rd-party applications that don't fit the standard Unix directory structure as well.  
    -VPN, printer software, self-written software

    * /run - 
    -Stores runtime data since last boot
    -TemptFS - everything is done here on reboot 
     -i.e: PID files, lock files, sockets. Cleared on reboot. 

    * /srv - (service directory)
    -Server files accessed by external users would be stored here. 
    -server files include: 
        -Web server files, 
        -FTP data, 
        -repository data.  

    * /sys - (system) 
    -A way to interact with the kernel 
    -Created every boot 
    -Virtual filesystem exposing kernel objects, hardware info, and device drivers. 
    -Similar to proc but more structured. Used for hardware and driver information. 

    *tmp - (temporary) 
    -files temporarily stored by apps and users. Usually cleared on reboot. 
    -i.e: you are writing a document in word, the cpu will save a copy here in case of crash  
    -emptied on reboot normally 

    *usr - (Unix System Resources)
    -Non-essential for basic system operation 
    -Applications/;software installed by the user are here
    -They are termed "secondary hiearchy" 

    * /var (variable)
